I wanted to take a moment to highlight some of the key activities and contributions I’ve delivered over the past year across Development, QA, and Scrum Master responsibilities:

Development Initiatives -
1. ICE Lookback Project - End-to-End Ownership and Delivery: 
Successfully led the end-to-end design, development, testing, and production implementation of the ICE Lookback project — a high-priority and time-sensitive initiative.
I have managed the full lifecycle, ensuring alignment with business requirements, tight delivery timelines, and seamless go-live without defects. 
This effort was instrumental in delivering key regulatory and functional capabilities on time. 
2. CS Feeds Migration: 
Played a crucial role in the urgent migration of Credit Suisse feeds to UBS, completed ahead of the January decommissioning. 
Despite year-end change freeze constraints, I ensured timely planning, development, and onboarding. 
3. Feed Onboarding - Tel Aviv, Istanbul, Dublin, Saudi & Athens: 
As part of a collaborative team effort, I have contributed significantly to the onboarding of regional feeds for multiple markets. 
My responsibilities included development, integration, and validation activities, helping ensure accurate and stable onboarding within aggressive timelines.


QA Activities - 
Throughout the year, I also have been responsible for the end-to-end testing of all deliverables, ensuring that each release met our quality standards and business expectations. This included functional, integration testing, with a focus on early defect identification and closure. 

Additionally, I have taken full ownership of the QA process lifecycle, which involved: Coordinating test planning and execution, ensuring timely closure of test packs & supporting release readiness and post-deployment validations.


Scrum Master - 
1. Sprint/Iteration Planning & Delivery: Facilitating planning sessions, backlog grooming, and tracking progress via velocity and burndown charts. 
2. Scrum Ceremonies: Managing stand-ups, reviews, retrospectives, and ensuring all ceremonies are effective and time-bound. 
3. Agile Process Adherence: Ensuring the team follows Agile practices and guidelines, and promoting continuous improvement. GitLab Maintenance: Keeping boards, issues, and milestones clean and up-to-date for transparent progress tracking.
